# ML Prediction - First Attempt

This repository contains my first attempt at building a Machine Learning prediction model. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Machine.ipynb`) that explores a dataset (`Beginner ML Teams.csv`), performs data preprocessing, and applies a predictive model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Basic ML model training and evaluation
- Experimentation with different algorithms

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

## Future Improvements
- Optimize model performance
- Add in more predictors
- Experiment with more advanced ML models

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements! ðŸš€
